# Chip-8
A Chip-8 emulator (interpreter, to be pedantic), debugger, and disassembler, made to run in a terminal. 
The emulator passes all testing ROMS I could get my hands on.
The disassembler isn't recursive; does not have any dependencies (code wise), and all its methods are `static`.
It can be used like this: `Disassembler::Disassemble(filename)`
The debugger, is pretty much what you'd expect, a nice UI to track registers and such, and the ability to step through the assembly while the program is running.

## Usage
To download and compile:

    git clone https://github.com/Hab5/chip8.git &&
    cd chip8 &&
    make release
    
To run the emulator: 

    ./chip8 your-file
Some ROMS are included in the `roms/` directory. ([Credit](#credit-for-the-roms-included))

## Dependency
- `ncurses` for the `Text User Interface (TUI)`
   - Most likely on your system already, if not, it is packaged for every package manager out there.  

## Keybindings
|              |                       |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| **`Escape`** | Quit                  |
| **`Enter`**  | Reset ROM             |
| **`Space`**  | Pause                 |
| **`Tab`**    | Step (when paused)    |
| **`-`**      | Decrease speed (20Hz) |
| **`+`**      | Increase speed (20Hz) |

## Specifications
Most of the information is sourced from [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM); the de facto  Chip-8 reference.  
### Memory
**4096 bytes of RAM**  
* `0x000 - 0x1ff` Reserved (used to be for the interpreter itself)
   - `0x50 - 0xAA`  Fontset: 16 * 5 bytes sprites (`0-F`)
      - Example for the `0` sprite:  
        | Sprite                  | Binary     | Hex  |
        |-------------------------|------------|------|
        | + + + + | 0b11110000 | 0xF0 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + + + + | 0b11110000 | 0xF0 |
* `0x200`- Entry Point of most Chip-8 programs
___
### Registers
- **`vA-vF`** 16 * 8-bit registers  
- **`I`** 16-bit Index register  
- **`PC`** 16-bit Program Counter  
- **`STACK`** 16 * 16-bit values to store return addresses from subroutines  
- **`SP`** 8-bit Stack Pointer (unused, as I make use of `std::vector` for the stack)  
- **`DT`** 8-bit Delay Timer  
- **`ST`** 8-bit Sound Timer  
___
### Display
- Resolution of **`64x32`**
- The TUI uses a resolution of **`64x16`** as it make uses of the lower half-block unicode character `â–„` in combination with the foreground/background color of a character cell to double the terminal's vertical resolution and simulate the correct aspect ratio.
___
### Timers & Sound
- **`Delay Timer`**: Is active whenever the **`DT`** register is non-zero. Is decremented by 1 at the rate of **60Hz**.  
- **`Sound Timer`**: Is active whenever the **`ST`** register is non-zero. Is decremented by 1 at the rate of **60hz**.  
    - When active, the Chip-8 buzzer will sound. This is emulated by printing the emulator frame in **red**.

### Instruction Set & Assembly mnemonics

- The Chip-8 has 36 different instructions  
- All instructions are two bytes long  
- The first byte of each instructions should be located at an even address in memory  
    - Sprites can be an uneven number of bytes, but must be padded so instructions following it stays properly situated in memory  
  
  
Variables in instructions are represented this way:  
    - **`0xfXYf`** X,Y = Nibbles (Used to designate registers)  
    - **`0xfNNN`** NNN = Address  
    - **`0xfNNf`** NN  = Byte  
    - **`0xfffN`** N   = Nibble
