# Chip-8

Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples.
These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. [<sup>1</sup>][^1]

## Specifications
### Memory
**4096 bytes of RAM**  
* `0x000 - 0x1ff` Reserved (used to be for the interpreter itself)
   - `0x50 - 0xAA`  Fontset: 16 * 5 bytes sprites (`0-F`)
      - Example for the `0` sprite:  
        | Sprite                  | Binary     | Hex  |
        |-------------------------|------------|------|
        | + + + + | 0b11110000 | 0xF0 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  + | 0b10010000 | 0x90 |
        | + + + + | 0b11110000 | 0xF0 |
* `0x200`- Entry Point of most Chip-8 programs
___
### Registers
- **`vA-vF`** 16 * 8-bit registers  
- **`I`** 16-bit Index register  
- **`PC`** 16-bit Program Counter  
- **`STACK`** 16 * 16-bit values to store return addresses from subroutines  
- **`SP`** 8-bit Stack Pointer (unused, as I use `std::vector` for the stack)  
- **`DT`** 8-bit Delay Timer  
- **`ST`** 8-bit Sound Timer  
___
### Display
- Resolution of **`64x32`**
- The TUI uses a resolution of **`64x16`** as it make uses of the lower half-block unicode character `â–„` in combination with the foreground/background color of a character cell to double the vertical resolution and simulate the correct aspect ratio.
__
### Timers & Sound
- **`Delay Timer`**: Is active whenever the **`DT`** register is non-zero. Is decremented by 1 at the rate of **60Hz**.  
- **`Sound Timer`**: Is active whenever the **`ST`** register is non-zero. Is decremented by 1 at the rate of **60hz**.  
    - When active, the Chip-8 buzzer will sound. This is emulated by printing the emulator frame in **red**.

___
### Instruction Set & Assembly mnemonics

- The Chip-8 has 36 different instructions  
- All instruction are two bytes long  
- The first byte of each instruction should be located at an even address in memory  
    - Sprites can be an uneven number of bytes, but must be padded so instructions following it stays properly situated in memory  
  
  
Variables in instructions are represented this way:  
    - **`0xfXYf`** X,Y = Nibbles (Used to designate registers)  
    - **`0xfNNN`** NNN = Address  
    - **`0xfNNf`** NN  = Byte  
    - **`0xfffN`** N   = Nibble
